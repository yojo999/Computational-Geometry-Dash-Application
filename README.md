# Computational Geometry Dashboard for three dimensional protein structures

## Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts and supporting data files for the **[Computational Geometry Dashboard for three dimensional protein structures]** using Dash.
This application aims to serve as a simple visual aid to interactively study the protein structure using the molecule3d viewer, a computational geometry chart (using Convex Hulls and Delaunay Tessellations), Ramachandran Chart, a Sequence Chart and the associated features resulting from the application of the two algorithms as a data table.
